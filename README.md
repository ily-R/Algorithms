- **randomized-quick_sort.py**: 

Detailed algorithm for randomized quick-sort that adapts to a sequence containing many equal elements, with O(n log(n) ) runningtime. Using only 2 partitions will lead to a quadratic runningtimeO(nÂ²). [runningtime plot](https://github.com/ilyasAr/Algorithms/blob/master/quick_sort.png)
