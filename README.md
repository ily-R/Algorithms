- **randomized-quick_sort.py**: 

Detailed algorithm for randomized quick-sort that adapts to a sequence containing many equal elements, with O(n log(n) ) runningtime. Using only 2 partitions will lead to O(nÂ²) runningtime if the data contains many equal elements.[The plot](https://github.com/ilyasAr/Algorithms/blob/master/quicksort.png)
